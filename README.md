## Overview

This repository documents security testing performed against **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** in an authorized laboratory environment.

The purpose of the assessment was to understand common web application vulnerabilities and their mitigation.

---

## Vulnerabilities Assessed

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected)
- Command Injection

---

## Lab Environment

| Component | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Attacker | Kali Linux |
| Target | DVWA |
| Environment | VirtualBox |
| Testing Type | Authorized Lab |

# Methodology

The assessment followed a structured testing methodology:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Intercepting HTTP traffic using Burp Suite
3. Manual payload injection
4. Request modification
5. Response analysis
6. Vulnerability validation
7. Risk assessment
8. Documentation
9. Remediation recommendations

---

# Key Findings

## 1. SQL Injection

**Severity:** High

The application concatenates user-controlled input directly into SQL queries without validation or parameterized statements.

**Impact**

- Authentication bypass
- Database enumeration
- Sensitive information disclosure
- Potential database compromise

Documentation:

```
sql-injection/
```

## 2. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Severity:** High

The application reflects unsanitized user input directly into the HTML response, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser.

### Demonstrated Payloads

```html
<script>alert(1)</script>
```

```html
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
```

### Impact

- JavaScript execution
- Session cookie disclosure
- Session hijacking
- Phishing attacks
- Client-side manipulation

Documentation:

```

```

# Skills Demonstrated

- Web Application Security Testing
- Vulnerability Validation
- HTTP Request Analysis
- Burp Suite Proxy & Repeater
- Manual Security Testing
- OWASP Top 10
- Secure Coding Awareness
- Technical Documentation
- Vulnerability Reporting

---

# Learning Outcomes

Through this assessment I gained practical experience in:

- Identifying web application vulnerabilities
- Understanding HTTP request/response flows
- Exploiting vulnerabilities safely within a controlled lab
- Assessing business and technical impact
- Preparing professional security assessment reports
- Recommending secure coding practices

---

### Command Injection

Performed manual testing of DVWA's Command Execution module using Burp Suite.

Activities performed:

- Captured HTTP POST requests
- Modified user-controlled parameters
- Verified operating system command execution
- Executed `whoami`
- Read `/etc/passwd`
- Established a reverse shell using Netcat
- Documented exploitation evidence
- Proposed remediation aligned with secure coding practices

## Disclaimer

Testing was performed only in an authorized educational laboratory.
