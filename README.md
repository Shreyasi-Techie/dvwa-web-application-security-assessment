# SQL Injection

## Objective

Demonstrate SQL Injection testing using DVWA and Burp Suite.

## Environment

- DVWA
- Kali Linux
- Burp Suite Community Edition
- Apache
- PHP
- MySQL

## Vulnerability

The application directly inserts user-controlled input into an SQL query without parameterized statements.

Payload used:

```sql
1' OR '1'='1
```

Result:

The application returned multiple database records instead of one, confirming successful SQL Injection.

## Evidence

| Screenshot | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 01 | DVWA Security Level |
| 02 | Normal Application Behaviour |
| 03 | Burp Proxy Capture |
| 04 | SQL Injection using Burp Repeater |
| 05 | Vulnerable Source Code |

## Skills Demonstrated

- Burp Suite
- HTTP Request Analysis
- SQL Injection Testing
- Command Injection Testing
- XSS Validation
- Security Documentation

## Disclaimer

Testing was performed only in an authorized educational laboratory.
